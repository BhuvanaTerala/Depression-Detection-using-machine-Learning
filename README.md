# Depression-Detection-using-machine-Learning
## Abstract
This research delves into the domain of depression detection using machine learning algorithms. Depression is a pervasive mental health condition with significant societal impacts, making early diagnosis crucial for effective intervention. In this study, we employ a comprehensive array of machine learning techniques, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Perceptron, and a Voting Classifier, to analyze and identify patterns within diverse datasets related to depression.
Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we assess the performance of these algorithms in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. Our findings shed light on the varying efficacy of these methods in detecting depression, highlighting potential avenues for improvement in automated diagnosis. This research significantly contributes to the advancement of depression detection systems, offering a promising means to enhance early intervention and mental health care, ultimately alleviating the burden of this debilitating condition on individuals and society as a whole.
